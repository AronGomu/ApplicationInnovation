## textGeneratorRNN.py
Contains RNN model, training algorythm and testing algorythms for RNN architecture

## textGeneratorLSTM.py
Contains LSTM model, training algorythm and testing algorythms for LSTM architecture

## textGeneratorGru.py
Contains GRU model, training algorythm and testing algorythms for GRU architecture

## utils.py
Contains utilitary functions

## stats.py
Contains function used to calculte statistical data from the models

## data folder
Contains the corpus used for training and testing the models

## logs
Json file containing accuracy, word generated matching words in test dataset and all word generated for the test of the model.
How to read the file name :
{name}_{chunk_length}_{number of epoch}_{batch size}_{number of hidden layer}_{number of layer}_{learning rate}.json
Those logs are generated only by testGeneratorLSTM because the other 2 use a different source code.

## models

Contains the save of the model generated.
How to read the file name :
{name}_{chunk_length}_{number of epoch}_{batch size}_{number of hidden layer}_{number of layer}_{learning rate}.pt
There are also rnn.pt and gru.py that are model generated by textGeneratorRNN and textGeneratorGru. They use hyper parameters:
* epoch : 100000
* batch size : 1
* hidden layer : 128
* number of layer : 2
* learning rate : 0.003 

## stats folder
Contains the output of the statistical analysis for russian names corpus and password corpus
